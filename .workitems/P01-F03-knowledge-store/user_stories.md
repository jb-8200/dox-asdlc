# User Stories: P01-F03 KnowledgeStore Interface and ChromaDB Backend

## Epic Reference

This feature implements **US 8.1: Query knowledge store for context enrichment** from the main User Stories document, plus foundational infrastructure for the RAG abstraction layer.

## User Stories

### US-F03-01: Define KnowledgeStore Interface

**As a** system architect
**I want** a well-defined interface for the knowledge store
**So that** agents can query for context without coupling to a specific implementation

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] `KnowledgeStore` protocol is defined in `src/core/interfaces.py`
- [ ] Protocol defines `index_document(doc_id, content, metadata) -> bool`
- [ ] Protocol defines `search(query, top_k, filters) -> list[SearchResult]`
- [ ] Protocol defines `get_by_id(doc_id) -> Document | None`
- [ ] Protocol defines `delete(doc_id) -> bool`
- [ ] Protocol defines `health_check() -> bool`
- [ ] All methods are async for non-blocking operation
- [ ] Type hints are complete and mypy-compliant

**Priority:** High

### US-F03-02: Define Data Models

**As a** developer
**I want** structured data models for documents and search results
**So that** I have type-safe access to knowledge store data

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] `Document` dataclass is defined with `doc_id`, `content`, `metadata`, `embedding` fields
- [ ] `SearchResult` dataclass is defined with `doc_id`, `content`, `metadata`, `score`, `source` fields
- [ ] Models support JSON serialization for debugging and logging
- [ ] Metadata supports string, int, float, and bool value types
- [ ] Score is a float between 0.0 and 1.0 representing relevance

**Priority:** High

### US-F03-03: Implement ChromaDB Backend

**As a** platform engineer
**I want** a working ChromaDB implementation of the KnowledgeStore
**So that** agents can store and retrieve documents in the prototype

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] `ChromaDBStore` class implements `KnowledgeStore` protocol
- [ ] Successfully connects to ChromaDB server via HTTP
- [ ] `index_document` stores content with metadata and generates embeddings
- [ ] `search` returns results ranked by semantic similarity
- [ ] `get_by_id` retrieves documents by their identifier
- [ ] `delete` removes documents from the collection
- [ ] `health_check` verifies backend connectivity
- [ ] Connection errors raise `BackendConnectionError`
- [ ] Operations handle ChromaDB-specific errors gracefully

**Priority:** High

---

### US-F03-04: Configure Embedding Generation

**As a** system operator
**I want** configurable embedding generation
**So that** I can choose between local and API-based embeddings

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Default embedding uses sentence-transformers `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`
- [ ] Embedding model is configurable via environment variable
- [ ] Embeddings are generated consistently for indexing and search
- [ ] Embedding errors raise `EmbeddingError` with details
- [ ] Embedding dimensions match ChromaDB collection configuration

**Priority:** Medium

### US-F03-05: Search with Relevance Scores

**As an** agent requiring context
**I want** search results with relevance scores
**So that** I can prioritize the most relevant information

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Search returns `SearchResult` objects with `score` field
- [ ] Scores are normalized between 0.0 (no match) and 1.0 (exact match)
- [ ] Results are sorted by score in descending order
- [ ] `top_k` parameter limits the number of results
- [ ] Empty queries return empty results (not error)

**Priority:** High

---

### US-F03-06: Filter Search by Metadata

**As an** agent
**I want** to filter search results by metadata
**So that** I can scope searches to specific document types or epics

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] `search` accepts optional `filters` parameter
- [ ] Filters support equality matching on metadata fields
- [ ] Multiple filters are combined with AND logic
- [ ] Invalid filter keys are ignored (not error)
- [ ] Filters work correctly with relevance scoring

**Priority:** Medium

---

### US-F03-07: Integrate ChromaDB with Docker

**As a** DevOps engineer
**I want** ChromaDB running in the infrastructure container
**So that** the knowledge store is available in the containerized environment

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] ChromaDB service added to `docker/docker-compose.yml`
- [ ] ChromaDB data persisted via Docker volume
- [ ] ChromaDB accessible from orchestrator and workers containers
- [ ] Health check verifies ChromaDB is responding
- [ ] ChromaDB port (8000) is not exposed to host (internal only)

**Priority:** High

---

### US-F03-08: Provide Factory Function

**As a** developer
**I want** a factory function to get the knowledge store
**So that** I can easily obtain a configured instance

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] `get_knowledge_store()` factory function exists
- [ ] Factory reads configuration from environment
- [ ] Factory returns singleton instance (connection reuse)
- [ ] Factory supports async context manager for cleanup
- [ ] Configuration errors raise `ConfigurationError`

**Priority:** Medium

---

### US-F03-09: Add KnowledgeStore Exceptions

**As a** developer
**I want** specific exceptions for knowledge store errors
**So that** I can handle different failure modes appropriately

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] `KnowledgeStoreError` base exception exists
- [ ] `DocumentNotFoundError` for missing documents
- [ ] `IndexingError` for indexing failures
- [ ] `SearchError` for search operation failures
- [ ] `EmbeddingError` for embedding generation failures
- [ ] `BackendConnectionError` for connection failures
- [ ] All exceptions include helpful error messages

**Priority:** Medium

---

### US-F03-10: Document the Interface

**As a** developer
**I want** documentation for the KnowledgeStore interface
**So that** I understand how to use it correctly

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Interface has complete docstrings
- [ ] Usage examples in code comments
- [ ] README or design doc includes API examples
- [ ] Migration path to other backends is documented
- [ ] Configuration options are documented

**Priority:** Low

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance

- Index operations should complete in < 1 second for typical documents
- Search operations should return in < 500ms for top_k <= 10
- System should handle 10,000+ indexed documents

### Reliability

- Backend unavailability should not crash agents
- Connection retries with exponential backoff
- Graceful degradation when knowledge store is unavailable

### Maintainability

- Interface changes require version bump
- Backend implementations are isolated and swappable
- Comprehensive test coverage (>80%)
