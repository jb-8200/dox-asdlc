    "description": "REVIEW APPROVED WITH NOTES - T09 Implementation

DECISION: ✅ Approved for continuation (NOT final merge)

WHAT WAS REVIEWED:
- T09: RepoMapper main class (mapper.py, models.py updates)
- 6 new unit tests (test_repo_mapper.py)
- Tasks.md progress update (75% complete)

POSITIVES:
✅ RepoMapper class well-structured
✅ ContextPack and FileContent models properly implemented
✅ Test coverage for core functionality
✅ Type hints present
✅ Atomic, well-described commits
✅ Follows project structure conventions

ISSUES TO FIX BEFORE FINAL MERGE:
❌ mapper.py:74 - Broad exception handler violates coding standards

Current code:
    except Exception:
        pass  # Violates standards

Coding standards require:
- Log errors before swallowing
- Use specific exceptions
- Never catch bare Exception without re-raising

Suggested fix:
    except (ParseError, IOError) as e:
        logger.debug(f"Skipping file {file_path}: {e}")
        continue

NEXT STEPS:
1. Continue with T10 (caching) and T11 (integration tests)
2. Fix exception handling in T09 code before requesting final merge
3. When ready for final merge: ensure 100% complete + all quality gates pass

Current status: 75% (9/12 tasks). T03 deferred (tree-sitter). Good progress!
