Any preferred alternatives?\n\n2. **WebSocket Strategy**: For TASK-003, should I implement:\n   - Native WebSocket with manual reconnection?\n   - socket.io-client (already added)?\n   - Both with fallback mechanism?\n\n3. **Mock Data Priority**: TASK-007 creates mock data for development. Should this\n   be prioritized earlier to enable parallel UI development without backend?\n\n4. **Integration Testing**: Current tests are unit tests only. When should I add\n   integration tests for store + API interactions?\n\n5. **Performance Baseline**: Should I run Lighthouse audits now to establish\n   baseline metrics, or wait until more UI components are implemented?\n\n6. **Branch Review Timing**: Would you like to review the branch after:\n   - Phase 1 complete (8 tasks, ~10h effort)?\n   - Phase 2 complete (18 tasks total)?\n   - Specific milestone?\n\nREQUEST:\n========\n- Feedback on approach and code quality so far\n- Answers to questions above (if available)\n- Any concerns or suggestions for remaining work\n- Confirmation to proceed with TASK-003\n\nESTIMATED COMPLETION:\n====================\n- Phase 1: ~8 hours remaining (6 tasks)\n- MVP Phase 1 (P0 pages): ~85 hours remaining (66 tasks)\n- Current velocity: ~2 tasks/session\n\nREADY FOR: Next task (TASK-003) pending orchestrator feedback\n\nTIMESTAMP: 2026-01-22T22:30:58Z\nREPORTER: frontend\nBRANCH: ui/P05-F06-hitl-ui-v2\nCOMMITS: 3e59bad, 5e53d31"
