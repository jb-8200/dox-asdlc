# Persistence - Hybrid RDB + AOF for coordination durability
#
# RDB provides point-in-time snapshots:
# - Fast restarts (load RDB, then replay AOF)
# - Compact backups for disaster recovery
#
# AOF provides write durability:
# - Max 1 second data loss on crash (everysec fsync)
# - Coordination messages are recoverable
#
# Trade-off: Slightly higher disk I/O vs data safety

# RDB snapshot settings (more frequent for coordination data)
# Every 60s if at least 1 key changed
save 60 1
# Every 5min if at least 10 keys changed
save 300 10
# Every 15min if at least 100 keys changed
save 900 100

# RDB file settings

# AOF (Append Only File) settings for durability
appendonly yes

# AOF fsync policy:
# - always: safest but slowest (every write)
# - everysec: good balance (up to 1 second data loss)
# - no: fastest but relies on OS (not recommended)
